*Work in progress...*

_Word of warning to code reviewers: This project serves as a useful toy project, with which I experiment with on the Rust language, therefore the code may or may not follow idiomatic style or reason and will look like sketch (which is what a lot of it is) containing unused code, commented code sections and a bit of chaos with code organization. As I get myself some free time to do so, from time to time I tend to do some refactoring and cleaning._
